# TEAM ACTIVITY 2: Innovate as a Team

Welcome back! We hope today is a productive day getting to know your team and coding! 

## Day 2 summary: 
Please complete the warm-up with your team, briefly review today’s objectives, and carefully read the end of the day report out items so you are familiar with the goals of the day.  

## Objectives for Day 2-3

2. Think about how to join your datasets together. 
3. Think about creating interesting graphics.
4. Report back on your results at the end of the day. Today’s report back is short and focused on your team process. The Day 3 report back is more detailed.

## Day 2 Report Back
Day 2 report-back questions are about the team *process*. We are interested in your team’s unique experience. For the report back, reflect on your team's process. Below are some prompts you might consider. You don't need to address all of them - choose which ones you want to present. Please limit your reflection to 2-3 mins.  
1. What worked well for your team?
2. What’s one thing you would change?
3. Did your group ever have an “ah-ha” moment?  What led up to that moment?
4. Did your group experience the groan zone?  What is one tip you want to share with future groups at the Summit about getting through the groan zone?

### Reminder
There is the opportunity for groups to continue working on their projects as an ESIIL Working Group. If you love your team and want to continue working together, considering submitting a Working Group Application this fall.
