## Research Question: Innovation for Inclusion or Computation (approx. time: 5-10 mins)
Write the research question your team selected in the space below. Feel free to revise the original question.

- How can data tools and environmental data science be used to continue to preserve and protect traditional and inherent ecological knowledge through languages and culture. 
-  


## Project Title (approx. time: 5-10 mins)
Craft a catchy title for your team’s project. Think of something that would grab attention at a conference or in a headline.

- Protecting and Preserving Traditional and Inherent Ecological Knowledge through Data Sovereignty


## Promoting Resilience and Adaptation
Describe how your proposed project aligns with the Summit's themes of resilience and adaptation. Please provide 1-2 sentences that clearly connect your project's goals or methods to these themes.

- Data sovereignty guidelines for Tribes.
- Indigenous languages holds many of these answers. 
- Raising awareness amongst grassroots people.
- Developing relationships of trust before any sharing can even occur.
- Developing protocols within a Tribal context. This may be different for different Tribal Nations


## Choosing Big Data Sets
Explore potential data sets for your project's topic from the [data library](https://cu-esiil.github.io/data-library/). List your options below, organizing them by whether they represent the system you're studying (e.g., deciduous forests) or the disruption to it (e.g., wildfire). Then discuss your choices and indicate your final selections.
- Local Context is being integrated into Cyverse with warnings for sensitive data sets.
- Murktu also allows labels and restrictions on data sets. It doesn't handle numerical data however. 
-  Traditional knowledge cannot be open data.
-  There are long-standing oral traditions, data is memorized rather than written down. 
-  Indigenous peoples hold and create their own data; co-creation is not an appropriate term. Sharing products from data is the choice of the Nations that hold 
   that data.
     

### Draft Potential Data Sets

### Final Choice
  - **System Being Perturbed/Disrupted (Final Choice):**
    - [Indicate your final selected data set here]
  - **Perturbator/Disrupter (Final Choice):**
    - [Indicate your final selected data set here]



## Brief Check-in: Definition of Resilience (approx. 5 mins)
Below is a working definition of the word "Resilience" for the Summit. Please edit the definition below based on your earlier discussion and chosen project.

*"Resilience is the capacity of a system, community, organization, or individual to absorb stress, recover from disruptions, adapt to change, and continue to develop and thrive."*
