# Introduction to the Tutorial on Historic Redlining and Environmental Analysis

## Understanding Redlining

Redlining is a term that originated in the 1930s, used to describe a discriminatory practice where banks and other lending institutions refused to offer mortgages or offered worse terms to people in specific neighborhoods based on racial and ethnic compositions. This practice was facilitated by maps created by the Home Ownersâ€™ Loan Corporation (HOLC), which color-coded areas deemed risky for investment in red, hence the term "redlining." These areas were typically home to minority populations and, as a result, were systematically denied access to investment and development opportunities.

The power of maps extends far beyond simple navigation aids; they are tools of communication and control. By drawing lines on a map, the HOLC didn't just reflect societal prejudices; they reinforced and perpetuated them. These maps dictated economic opportunities and shaped the physical and social architecture of communities for generations. As a visual representation of exclusion, redlining maps not only influenced perceptions but also had a tangible impact on the urban landscape, determining where infrastructure was built, where services were provided, and ultimately, who would thrive and who would not. [Jackson, K. T. (1985). *Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States.* Oxford University Press.]

The consequences of redlining are profound and long-lasting. Economically and socially, these practices contributed to a cycle of poverty, racial segregation, and an entrenched wealth gap that still persists. Environmentally, the neighborhoods targeted by redlining often suffer from significant injustices. These areas typically have reduced access to green spaces, higher exposure to pollutants, and greater vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, further compounding the health and well-being challenges faced by their residents. [Rothstein, R. (2017). *The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America.* Liveright Publishing.]

Through mapping these injustices and understanding their origins, we gain insight into the systemic barriers that have shaped our cities. This tutorial not only aims to uncover the legacy of redlining but also to illustrate how such policies continue to affect urban environments today, demonstrating the powerful role that mapping plays in urban policy and social equity.

## Goals of the Tutorial

This tutorial aims to explore the historical context of redlining using the HOLC's data available for Philadelphia and then to examine the current environmental conditions of these historically redlined areas compared to non-redlined areas. By integrating historical redlining data with contemporary environmental data, we can observe the persistent effects of past policies on present-day urban landscapes.

## Tutorial Overview

1. **Part 1: Accessing and Visualizing Historical Redlining Data**
   - We will download and plot the geographic boundaries of redlined areas using GeoJSON data from the HOLC. This part will guide you on how to use R and Python to visualize these historic policies spatially.

2. **Part 2: Integrating Environmental Satellite Data**
   - In this part, we will retrieve environmental satellite data to analyze the environmental quality indicators such as vegetation, air quality, and surface temperature for the areas within and outside the redlined boundaries.

3. **Part 3: Comparative Analysis and Visualization**
   - We will perform statistical analyses to compare environmental conditions in redlined versus non-redlined areas and visualize the disparities. This involves creating maps and graphs that highlight the environmental inequities linked to historic redlining.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a deeper understanding of how historical urban policies continue to affect modern urban environments and how to analyze these impacts using geographic and environmental data.
