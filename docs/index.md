# Big Data for Environmental Resilience and Adaptation 
May 14th-16th, 2024
University of Colorado Boulder

ESIIL's 2024 Innovation Summit will offer an opportunity to use big data to understand resilience across genes, species, ecosystems and societies, advance ecological forecasting with solutions in mind, and inform adaptive management and natural climate solutions. The Summit will support attendees to advance data-informed courses of action for resilience and adaptation in the face of our changing environment. It will be an in-person ‘unconference’, enabling participants to dynamically work on themes that most inspire them, with inclusive physical and intellectual spaces for working together. Over two and a half days participants will work in teams to explore research questions using open science approaches, including: data infrastructure, artificial intelligence (AI) and novel analytics, and cloud computing. Participants will be encouraged to work across and respect different perspectives, with the aim of co-developing resilience solutions. ESIIL will provide participants with opportunities to learn more about cultural intelligence, ethical and open science practices, and leadership in the rapidly evolving field of environmental data science. Overall, the Summit will capitalize on the combination of open data and analytics opportunities to develop innovative or impactful approaches that improve environmental resilience and adaptation.

## Why Big Data for Environmental Resilience and Adaptation?
Humans have vastly altered ecosystems, leading to habitat and biodiversity loss, climate change, and altered nutrient and water cycles. At the same time, we are in an unprecedented moment where vast amounts of data are being produced about our planet faster than we can generate insights in a responsible way. We urgently need solutions that foster equitable use of our planet’s resources and better distribute the burden of adaptation.

## The goals of the 2024 ESIIL Innovation Summit are to: 
Explore big data for environmental resilience and adaptation by identifying data synthesis opportunities and utilizing ESIIL cloud-compute capabilities. 
Promote best practices in ethical, open science, by supporting accessibility and usability of environmental data by all stakeholders. Champion ethical and equitable practices in environmental science, honoring data sovereignty and encouraging the responsible use of AI. 
Support diverse and inclusive teams by establishing collaborations around data-inspired themes across different disciplines, sectors, career stages, and backgrounds.
Encourage the co-production of environmental knowledge with communities that are experiencing significant environmental challenges.
